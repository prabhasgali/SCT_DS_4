# SCT_DS_4
Exploratory Data Analysis and insightful visualizations on the US Accidents (March 2023) dataset. Includes Google Colab-compatible Python notebooks for analyzing traffic patterns related to weather, road conditions, and time of day.

# 📌** Objective **
🔹Analyze a large real-world US accidents dataset to:

🔹Identify common weather conditions during accidents.

🔹Study accident frequency by time of day.

🔹Visualize accident distribution by US state.

🔹Provide insights to help improve road safety and traffic management.

# 📁** Files Included **
⚫Prabhas_task_4.ipynb — Google Colab-ready notebook covering:

⚫Data upload instructions for large CSVs.

⚫Data cleaning and feature engineering.

⚫Visualizations: top weather conditions, hourly accident trends, state-wise hotspots.

⚫Clear, interpretable charts using seaborn and matplotlib.

# 🔑** Key Steps **
✳️Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents

✳️Preprocessing: Handling missing values and extracting useful time features.

✳️Visualization: Count plots for weather conditions, hourly patterns, and state distribution.

✳️Insights: Discover accident hotspots and understand contributing factors.
