# SCT_DS_4
Exploratory Data Analysis and insightful visualizations on a real-world Traffic Accident dataset. This Google Colab-compatible notebook analyzes traffic patterns related to weather, road conditions, and time of day — helping uncover accident hotspots and contributing factors.

# **📌 Objective*
🔹 Analyze a real traffic accident dataset to:

🔹Identify common weather conditions during accidents

🔹Study accident frequency by hour of the day

🔹Visualize accident distribution by road surface condition

🔹Provide insights for better road safety and traffic management

# **📁 Files Included*
⚫ Prabhas_task_4.ipynb — A ready-to-run Colab notebook covering:

⚫ CSV upload and reading instructions

⚫ Data cleaning and feature extraction

⚫ Visualizations: top weather conditions, hourly trends, and road surface impact

⚫ Clean, easy-to-interpret charts using seaborn and matplotlib

# **🔑 Key Steps*
✳️ Data Source: Traffic Accident Dataset (Kaggle)

✳️ Preprocessing: Handle missing values and extract time-based insights

✳️ Visualization: Count plots for weather, hourly distribution, and road surface type

✳️ Insights: Spot accident hotspots and understand risk factors

# **🛠️ Tools Used*
📍 Python
📍 pandas
📍 seaborn
📍 matplotlib
📍 Google Colab

# **🚀 Outcome*
This project demonstrates how to handle and analyze a real-world traffic dataset, discover when and why accidents are most likely to occur, and create clear visual stories that aid urban planners and traffic safety stakeholders.
