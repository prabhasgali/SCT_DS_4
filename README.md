# SCT_DS_4
Exploratory Data Analysis and insightful visualizations on a real-world Traffic Accident dataset. This Google Colab-compatible notebook analyzes traffic patterns related to weather, road conditions, and time of day — helping uncover accident hotspots and contributing factors.

📌 Objective
🔹 Analyze a real traffic accident dataset to:

Identify common weather conditions during accidents

Study accident frequency by hour of the day

Visualize accident distribution by road surface condition

Provide insights for better road safety and traffic management

📁 Files Included
Prabhas_task_4.ipynb — A ready-to-run Colab notebook covering:

CSV upload and reading instructions

Data cleaning and feature extraction

Visualizations: top weather conditions, hourly trends, and road surface impact

Clean, easy-to-interpret charts using seaborn and matplotlib

🔑 Key Steps
✳️ Data Source: Traffic Accident Dataset (Kaggle)
✳️ Preprocessing: Handle missing values and extract time-based insights
✳️ Visualization: Count plots for weather, hourly distribution, and road surface type
✳️ Insights: Spot accident hotspots and understand risk factors

🛠️ Tools Used
📍 Python
📍 pandas
📍 seaborn
📍 matplotlib
📍 Google Colab

🚀 Outcome
This project demonstrates how to handle and analyze a real-world traffic dataset, discover when and why accidents are most likely to occur, and create clear visual stories that aid urban planners and traffic safety stakeholders.
