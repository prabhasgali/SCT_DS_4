# SCT_DS_4
Exploratory Data Analysis and insightful visualizations on the US Accidents (March 2023) dataset. Includes Google Colab-compatible Python notebooks for analyzing traffic patterns related to weather, road conditions, and time of day.

📌 Objective
Analyze a large real-world US accidents dataset to:

Identify common weather conditions during accidents.

Study accident frequency by time of day.

Visualize accident distribution by US state.

Provide insights to help improve road safety and traffic management.

📁 Files Included
US_Accidents_Analysis.ipynb — Google Colab-ready notebook covering:

Data upload instructions for large CSVs.

Data cleaning and feature engineering.

Visualizations: top weather conditions, hourly accident trends, state-wise hotspots.

Clear, interpretable charts using seaborn and matplotlib.

sample_us_accidents.csv (optional) — Small sample file for quick testing.

🔑 Key Steps
Data Source: US Accidents (March 2023) on Kaggle

Preprocessing: Handling missing values and extracting useful time features.

Visualization: Count plots for weather conditions, hourly patterns, and state distribution.

Insights: Discover accident hotspots and understand contributing factors.

🛠️ Tools Used
Python

pandas
